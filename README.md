# GoLangBot-Tutorial
A tutorial of the language Go.

This repo is a compilation of my efforts to learn Golang, from the [Golangbot](https://golangbot.com/learn-golang-series/) site. Head over to [https://golangbot.com/learn-golang-series/](https://golangbot.com/learn-golang-series/) and check out this structured and well-planned tutorial.

P.S. Good job [Naveen](https://golangbot.com/about/)!
